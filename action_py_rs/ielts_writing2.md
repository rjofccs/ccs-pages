## 01规定. :rotating_light:obey rules:
Children ______ different rules either at home or at school. Strict discipline is sometimes important, but I would argue that it would ______ children's problem-solving abilities.  
好行为 禁止不好的 例子：好礼仪 坏好礼仪  
Some people strong ______ rules because rules can ______ children ______ their behaviour and help them develop good behaviour patterns from a young age. Unlike adults, children ______ the consequences of bad behaviour, and setting rules can help them realise how to behave in a socially acceptable way. For example, they can learn how to ______ if they are required by adults to do so. In addition, rules can also forbid inappropriate behaviours, such as ______ during a lesson.  
独立思考 例子：别人指导工作  
Opponents, however, argue that rules can ______ of problem-solving skills if those parents who establish strict rules ______ children's obedience. Children will rely heavily on rules and may not be able to solve problems independently. For instance, some rules may dictate what children should do every day, but when children ______, they may not know how to ______ without the instructions of their parents and ______ themselves. They are unlikely to ______.  
例子：学生论文  
In my view, strict rules can stifle children's creativity, and they are not able to solve problems in different ways. They dare not ______ since they are afraid of being punished if they disobey rules. Some teachers, for example, require students to abide by strict essay writing rules, and the consequence is that children will not know the outcome of ______ in other ways. The problems in the real world are complex, and they cannot ______ without using imagination.

## 02电视. :tv:television viewing:
教育价值  
Watching television(especially informational television) has been ______ an effective method of learning because audio-visual information can ______. Although many TV programmes have educational values, I do not agree with the idea of increasing screen time.  
能力 社交  
Television viewing can ______, which can ______ these children's intellectual development. They may not be able to ______ in exams because screen time displaces the time they could spend doing homework. It is also worrying to see that television viewing can ______ which can improve children's intellectual skills, such as ______. Another problem is that long screen time can limit children's social development. Those children who sit in front of their TV for many hours, instead of playing games with their peers and ______ teachers, will become unsociable and unwilling to ______ other people. Without good communication skills, they will have difficulty in ______ classmates or teachers, and achieving academic success.  
补充知识  
On the other hand, I understand that television has ______ a world of knowledge. There are many educational programmes aimed at children, allowing them to ______ different subjects. For example, documentaries can help children ______ historical events, while foreign language channels can help them acquire a foreign language. This kind of knowledge can ______ what they learn at school.  
To summarise, I would argue that parents and teachers should ______ children's television viewing, although television shows are a source of knowledge. Watching TV can ______ exam grades and social skills.

## 03道德. :trophy:virtues and moral values:trophy::
不能成功  
Schools are normally seen as the place where the next generation can ______. In my view, academic subjects are important to one's ______, but students who do not learn the difference between right and wrong cannot succeed in their ______.  
大学 工作 没时间  
Many teachers suggest that students should ______ core subjects because their performance in these courses can determine whether they can enter university in the future. What students can ______ courses can ______ university and help them find decent jobs. For example, students who acquire mathematical skills at school can learn how to ______ at university and work as ______ after they graduate. They are less likely to focus on key disciplines if they are required to spend time studying ______.  
产品  
On the other hand, some educationalists are in favour of imparting some important ______ to students, motivating the next generation to make good use of knowledge to ______ their future employers and the whole society. Students who ______ are more likely to design safe products which benefit consumers if they work as engineers ______ in the future. Students who do not have a moral compass cannot ______, even though they perform well at school.  
交流  
In my opinion, the younger generation cannot be successful if they are not able to ______. Students who learn politeness and social rules may understand how to ______ classmates, and because of this, they will also be able to ______ colleagues once they start working. This is the key to ______. If they do not realise this, their education and career can ______.

## 04义工. :raised_hands:volunteer work:
Many schools have ______ volunteer work and even accepted it as a requirement for graduation. Unpaid work may have its downside, but it is of ______ for those young participants and society.  
能力 服务  
By providing community services, students can ______ and ______. Students may ______ many problems and challenges, which are rare at school when involved in these voluntary services. For example, when raising funds for charities, they should figure out how to ______ benefactors, organise events or functions, and work closely with others. These activities can ______ cooperating with people from all walks of life and improve their problem-solving abilities.     The younger generation can learn responsibility and enjoy serving the community. They have a sense of community since they can see how their work can positively impact other community members. Examples include helping disadvantaged children ______, supporting caregivers in nursing homes, and assisting disabled people in overcoming difficulties in their daily lives. If young people are all happy to ______ others, it will create a ______ society.  
无价值 干涩  
On the other hand, we cannot ______ that unpaid work can waste volunteers' time and energy if not well-organised. Volunteer work programmes are sometimes tedious and strenuous, and many students do not see unpaid work as ______ that is of educational value. They may also regard voluntary work as a service that can ______ their study time and ______ their studies.  

Overall, I believe that volunteer work is of considerable importance to the next generation in terms of sharpening skills, fostering ______, and social progress. However, schools should make sure that it ______.

## 05住宿. :bed:university accommodation:
rite 父母联系  
Many students have chosen university accommodation or shared a flat with their friends. It is a rite of passage though these young people may be unable to ______ their parents.  
独立 社交  
Living away from parents means that young people must learn how to live independently. They must develop some life skills, such as housekeeping, managing finances and getting along with flatmates. With these skills, they can ______ easily once they enter the workforce. For example, they are more likely to ______ if they have ______ cleaning their bedrooms.     In addition, college students can ______ in social life and make new friends. They do not need to go home every day, so they have more time to do a wide range of activities, including going to the gym with other students, doing ______ and even doing part-time work together. Moreover, partying, club activities and backpacking allow these young people to ______ friends, so they have personal resources to ______ in future careers.  
父母联系  
The downside of this choice is that the contact with parents will decline, and the emotional tie will suffer. They hardly have a meal with their parents and cannot ______ their family. As they can tackle problems independently, they do not feel the need to visit their family and ______ their parents. This may also affect their attitude toward family life.  

In conclusion, it is a good decision for university students to leave home, although it may damage their family relationships.

## 06大学. :orange_book:a university degree:
成功人士  
Understandably, some young people today ______ college because there are successful entrepreneurs or business leaders who did not complete a university degree. I believe what students learn at university is vitally essential to a fulfilling career.  
专业知识 多学科解决问题  
By learning theories at university, people can ______ concepts and principles of different subjects to ______ in their professions. Many theories have developed based on empirical knowledge. So these theories have practical implications, and people who are familiar with theories can ______ practical problems at work. For example, a psychiatrist cannot identify effective therapies unless he or she attends some university courses to ______ all theories about the causes of different mental health problems.     Academic study can also improve the problem-solving abilities of learners and empower them to ______. University students need to collect information on different subject matters to finish essays and reports to ______ analysing foreign matters and tackling them effectively. When they ______ their careers, they will ______ researching when problems surface and ______ corresponding solutions. In contrast, those who did not go to university may receive some ______ to deal with some general tasks, but they may be helpless in the face of unusual problems. 
唯一条件 性格  
Meanwhile, we must recognise that theoretical knowledge is not the only determinant of success. Many successful people have some ______ in common. An optimistic, hardworking and sociable person can overcome difficulties and ______ others to achieve success. Another factor might be the social network, by which people can ______ ideas of experts, investors and business managers, such as those managers who understand how to ______ clients, suppliers and government officials. This kind of knowledge may not be available in textbooks.  

Higher education has been undervalued, and people can ______ effectively and creatively with the knowledge they have acquired at university. On the other hand, we need to admit that personality and social relationships are also essential to success.  
```

## 07助学. :dollar:financial assistance:
入学 困难  
Receiving a university education ______ many young people because they can ______ easily in the future. Those who support government spending on education think some students do not enrol because of learning costs. I believe students should ______ while the disadvantaged can ______ from the government.  
积极学习 政府负担（如果做如果不做）  
If higher education is not free of charge, students will study hard and take this educational opportunity seriously. They understand the financial cost of ______, so they consciously try to finish all assignments and pass all exams to qualify on time. In contrast, in cases where they have free access to education, they will possibly ______ and fail their exams from time to time.     Another benefit of charging tuition fees is that it can ______ the government. More money can be used in primary and secondary education, reducing illiteracy and preparing the next generation for university-level courses. Additionally, subsidies can be provided for those students who ______ post-graduate courses, and investing in these talented young people can ______.  
困难 （如果做如果不做）  
On the other hand, young people from less well-off backgrounds can ______ tuition. They will ______ attend college to acquire knowledge and skills to improve their career prospects. This can ______ between haves and have-nots and help build a fair society. Conversely, tuition fees may force them to drop out of college and make it difficult for them to ______.  

To summarise, Students from deprived backgrounds should be exempt from tuition fees, while the abolition of tuition for all students is not realistic(practical).  
```

## 08广告. :video_game:advertisements:video_game::
零售玩具  
Many children ______ a large number of advertisements in the modern world. These advertisements have encouraged them to buy many snacks, toys and video games, and I agree that advertisements aimed at children should be ______.  
商品 价格；行为  
If advertising campaigns directed at children are regulated, children will not pester their parents to buy many goods for them. Children ______ prices and do not realise that the products promoted by advertisements, such as toys and fashionable clothes, can ______. If they are not bombarded with advertisements, they will not nag(pester) their parents to purchase those expensive products.     Advertisements are also responsible for many behavioural problems and lifestyle issues among children. For instance, some children like fast food since they are overwhelmed by fast food advertisements every day. They ______ violent electronic games advertised on television, and playing these games can make them aggressive and temperamental. Imposing an outright ban on these advertisements can help reduce poor behaviour on campus, such as ______.  
营养信息 教育价值  
On the other hand, we should recognise the advantage of advertisements. For example, some advertisements ______ about nourishing food like milk and cereal, and there are also many commercials selling books, games and toys of educational value. Parents can purchase the best products with the information from commercials when they do not know the options available in the market.  

Overall, I agree that governments should ______ those advertisements which ______ of products harmful to the next generation.

## 09英语. :earth_americas:English:

English has ______ a global language and has been used as a global vehicle for cross-cultural communication worldwide. The ______ of this language worldwide can be viewed positively, although it might ______.  
公司学者合作 理解知识  
The ______ of English worldwide helps promote international cooperation, enabling people to overcome language barriers ______. Entrepreneurs can conduct business together and discuss how to ______ a company and import products, regardless of their native language. Moreover, many international conferences and academic groups have identified English as the primary language. Scholars can share knowledge and ideas or cooperate to complete projects in different study areas.     In addition, the dominance of English can help people ______. About 80% of the world's websites publish articles in English, so people who master this language can read news, magazines and books on the web and learn more about the world. They can easily travel to different parts of the world and ______ these places' customs.  
治疗 饮食  
Despite the contribution of the English language to globalisation, it is considered the main ______ of the loss of cultural diversity. The idea lies in the fact that young people in many parts of the world ______ study English instead of their mother tongue. Some less spoken languages may eventually ______, so those traditional therapies, recipes, religious practices and ceremonies preserved by people speaking these languages. Our knowledge about the world will be limited if some cultures disappear. 

In conclusion, English ______ communication and cooperation among people from different countries, although some people suspect that English will endanger some minority languages.

A healthy lifestyle is important because it directly affects our ______. Although many people regard lifestyle choices as personal, I do not think they will adopt a healthy lifestyle unless the government intervenes.  
快乐 外表  
Some people insist they should have the freedom to decide how to ______; otherwise, they will be unhappy. They ______ develop and maintain healthy habits believing that these habits can bring enjoyment to their lives. For example, some may increase their intake of fruit and vegetables to ______. If they are confident in their ______, they will have a positive attitude towards life and ______. Conversely, they will ______ if forced to follow the government's lifestyle guidelines.  
吸烟 教育和税收  
On the other hand, it is sometimes argued that ______ some behaviours, especially those ______ damaging to health, is more important. Many people lack self-discipline. For example, they smoke, although it is common knowledge that smoking endangers their health. They would not quit smoking unless the government ______ and forbade citizens to smoke publicly. In my view, the government should ______ educating the public about what to do and offering guidance. People should ______ how damaging their ways of life can be. For example, advertising will try to exercise regularly if the government ______ to convey that a sedentary job can adversely affect health and reduce life expectancy.  

______ should also provide information about the health problems caused by fast food, so consumers will ______ healthy eating and carefully read the nutritional information on food packaging.

## 11节约. :iphone:throw-away culture:
People ______ use products only once instead of keeping these items for a long time. It is important to understand why this throw-away culture has developed and how to ______.  
便宜 新 环保  
Consumers today do not keep many goods for a long period of time because these products are not as expensive as before. ______ have reduced the cost of production and improved the ______ of the workforce. Some electronic products such as mobile phones and computers are now sold ______, and this is why many people would purchase the newest product instead of ______. Young people, in particular, prefer the latest mobile phones with up-to-date features and throw old ones away. Another reason is that people ______. People have not yet realised that ______ will lead to energy consumption and cause waste as well as pollution. They do not know that ______ can end up in landfill sites, and these non-biodegradable products can ______ the environment. If they are aware that recycling can make lifestyles more sustainable, they will possibly try to reuse products.  
法律税收教育  
As the overconsumption of ______ is pervasive, it is important to take some measures to mitigate this problem. The first one is to raise environmental awareness, educating people to change the ways they use and ______ different products. Governments can also ______ consumers from throwing away goods. For example, the tax penalty can be imposed on the use of some ______, including plastic bags, thereby encouraging people to use eco-friendly alternatives.  

To summarise, people's changing attitudes toward consumption and ______ are the main reasons behind ______ of consumer goods. To address this problem successfully, the ______ is to raise people's awareness of environmental protection and motivate them to change their lifestyles.

## 12网课. :computer:distance learning:
网络发展  
The advent of the Internet has ______ people ______. A growing number of people are now considering distance education, which allows them to ______ at home.  
课本 交互工具  
Although distance learning ______ a traditional college education in some aspects, learners will possibly find that they can ______ an online course as they do at university. In distance learning programmes, students can access the same content of the degree as those who attend lectures in person. They can read relevant materials, such as textbooks and class notes, and attend video lessons, which are recorded lectures of reputable professors. When they have problems comprehending some key concepts, they can click the pause button and replay the video until they fully ______. The improvements in online education also make it possible for students to communicate with their lecturers whenever necessary. Students can use interactive communication tools to ask questions in virtual classes or talk to lecturers via email. In this way, these learners can get lecturers' guidance immediately, thereby completing all courses more effectively. This is exactly the same as the interaction with professors ______. Despite living in their own countries, students can even communicate with scholars from top universities around the world.  
交流 活动  
While distance education has clear advantages, it may not offer participants the same networking experience they can get in a brick-and-mortar college. Students complete their degrees independently and do not have opportunities to meet each other and socialise together. This can have a negative impact on their career development ______ the importance of ______ contacts. In contrast, those who study at university can do a wide range of activities on campus, such as playing sports and joining clubs, which can help them ______.  

In conclusion, interactive technology has enabled learners to ______ lectures easily and gain the qualification, so I believe that distance education is now as good as traditional ways of ______ at university.

## 13迁移. :cityscape:shift to cities:
工作 生活  
These days many people from rural areas have chosen to ______ cities, believing that they are more likely to ______ and ______ in urban areas, but the movement of the population can cause(bring out) many problems.  
工作 公共服务  
There are two main reasons why these people have made this decision. Firstly, cities are more densely populated, and there are more ______ available, so they may earn more money. This means that they can ______ and afford more ______ than ever before. By contrast, employment opportunities are scarce in rural areas ______ many industries are underdeveloped and many ______ is limited.     Another advantage of urban life is that city dwellers have easy access to ______, including education and health care, and young couples who used to live in the countryside ______ their children to urban schools to get prepared for better job opportunities in the future.  
地 生活差 垃圾处理 差异  
The increased number of urban dwellers can ______ housing and facilities in cities. Some cities are unable to accommodate a large population because of a shortage of land. Many migrants ______ in slums and enduring poor living conditions because they cannot afford home ownership. All city dwellers ______ poor health because urban facilities do not ______ manage waste and sewage effectively and ______ clean water.     Another problem associated with a rural-to-urban shift is that rural-urban income ______ will grow instead of diminishing. Young people who are ambitious, energetic, hardworking and creative prefer to go to the cities ______ educational and employment opportunities. The shortage of labour has thus become a problem in rural communities, and it is not easy to revitalise the local economy.  

In conclusion, poor ______ and sluggish local economies have caused the population to shift to cities. This is a worrying trend.

## 14离职. :man_office_worker:change x or are dismissed:

In this rapidly changing world, it is no longer realistic to expect to have a permanent job. People should take action to ______ the challenges of job insecurity, whether they decide to ______ or ______ by their employers.  
经济 科技 实现价值  
There are so many unpredictable factors in the world of work that employers have to ______ the workforce. For example, in times of economic recession, companies have to lay off some employees to reduce the running cost, which means that many people will lose their jobs. Technology has been developing so fast that many people have failed to ______ to meet the requirements of their employers. Some of them may ______, for example, for the simple reason that they do not have the knowledge about the newest generation of software and ______ the changes in the workplace.     Another reason why few people expect to stay in the same job for a lifetime is because they are interested in a varied career. They work for different companies to ______. While some ______ work for large companies, where they can ______, some may choose to work for start-ups, where they ______ more responsibilities.  
提升 经济问题  
Because of the uncertainty about job prospects, working adults must pay attention to two significant issues. They should ______ and receive education to ensure they can ______ an ever-changing world. One example is ______ of attending courses to acquire a second language because many companies operate in a globalized world. In addition, they should ______ to cope with all ______ unemployment. They can even run their own business with ______ if they fail to find employment.

## 15快餐. :hamburger:fast food chains:
生活节奏 工作时间  
Many people today frequent ______ because of ______. Fast food has threatened traditional cuisine in many cultures, and people should not overlook the problems that may ______ this change.  
肥胖 经济1  
The strong appetite for fast food has become ______ in countries like America, where the number of overweight people has increased dramatically. This kind of food is not only high in fat, sugar, salt and calories but also served in large portions. This is why it is known as junk food and linked to ______. Those who ______ obesity are more likely to contract ______ than normal-weight people. This means that governments have to pour more money into the medical system, which may adversely affect ______.  
多样性2  
Another problem is that it can threaten the diversity of the world's cuisine. Traditional means of food preparation ______ the diversity of ingredients, cooking styles and flavours, and many traditional dishes show the evolution of cuisine in different regions. ______ fast food chains that provide American or European food, including hamburgers, fried chicken and pizza, dominate the market. ______, people will find that their diet will become increasingly monotonous and that some traditional recipes may vanish.  
家庭关系3  
The reliance on pre-prepared food also harms family relationships, as people do not eat family meals as frequently as before. As a general rule, family meals allow family members to communicate with each other and ______. People who consistently eat outside may not be able to ______ family issues and ______ the emotional needs of other family members. They no longer have a sense of closeness at home and ______ their family.  

I thus agree that the popularity of fast food is a menace. It threatens people's health and their cuisine, culture and social relationship.

## 16垃圾. :wastebasket:household waste:
环境 方法 立法  
Household waste has become ______ the environment, especially in large cities where many consumers now tend to buy more than they need. In order to encourage them to ______, governments should ______, in addition to legislation.   
法律1  
Laws can be enforced to punish those who do not ______ rubbish in an environmentally friendly way, thereby ______ all people to reduce the waste they produce. Because of the ______, they would be more ______ waste management. For example, they may have to pay extra fees when they ______ excessive waste. Families who do not separate rubbish and put recyclable items, including paper, glass, bottles and electrical equipment, in respective rubbish bins will be fined.  
教育2  
While rigid rules can change behaviour, it is also essential to educate the public about the impact of waste on the environment. People would not ______ to go green if they did not realise that waste could ______. Everybody should be aware that plastic bottles and cans, if not recycled, will end up in landfill sites and that the ______ contained in these items can cause serious environmental problems.  
超市3  
It is also necessary to increase recycling facilities in communities. Supermarkets and shopping malls can put bottle banks in prominent positions to collect bottles from passers-by, while colour-coded recycling bins can help people ______ waste more efficiently. Without these facilities, they could not ______ the waste pre-treatment process, even though they understand it is a ______ to recycle waste effectively.  

To conclude, setting more ______ is one effective way to promote recycling, but ______ and investment in facilities are equally important.

## 17分享. :information_source:facilitate information:
科技 问题 滥用  
Globalisation, along with the ______ of digital technology, has ______ among academics and business people, regardless of nationality and race. I agree that easy access to valuable information can ______ and address some global problems, despite the risk that some information can be misused.  
问题 滥用  
We can find solutions to problems easily if we have unlimited ______ to different databases, such as those which contain information about how to ______. This kind of knowledge is not available to people living in some poorest sections of the world, and this is why they are still ______ some preventable diseases and problems that can otherwise be avoided.     Some people are reluctant to share their know-how because they are afraid that their knowledge and intellectual properties can be exploited. This is particularly understandable in the business world, where companies are not willing to provide information about their managerial skills, software and patented products on the Internet. Their competitiveness would be ______ if their global competitors could ______ such information.  
合作  
I would, however, view this issue in a positive light. While it ______ business owners to decide what information is withheld, they should ______ their peers in the same industry. It can create an atmosphere world wide in which designers, inventors and engineers can mine each other's information with permission and ______ creative solutions without having to ______ through trial and error.  

In conclusion, it may not be practical to require all people to give up the ownership of their essential knowledge, but they should accept that sharing in a globalised world is better than concealing information.

医疗 慢  
One problem associated with an ageing population is that ______ will increase, ______ taxpayers. It is widely known that most medical needs and costs occur in the last years of life. This means that governments have to ______ caring for the elderly and medical services. This is normally achieved by requiring working people to ______ and ______ like education.     The slow pace of work is another problem, as the number of senior workers increases. The ability to absorb information and complete work normally ______. Many elderly have a conservative attitude towards technology and ______ learn how to use hi-tech devices and the lasted software at work. If they choose to delay retirement, their presence in the workforce can ______ companies' productivity and endanger the whole economy.

On the other hand, the ______ of senior citizens can be ______ to society. People today can live healthier and longer lives as they pay closer attention to healthy eating and sports. They can work as consultants even after leaving the workforce and ______ the younger generation. For example, some senior managers can teach young people how to manage a company and how to provide better service for clients. Our society can ______ of these older people.  

In conclusion, the considerable extension of life expectancy has ______ health care and made the workforce less productive. It will influence the economic development of a country, although we can make good use of senior workers' wisdom.

## 19航空. :airplane:low-cost air travel:
Low-cost air travel has enabled us to ______ more frequently than before. I think cheap flights can ______, though we should avoid unnecessary journeys.  
了解 工作  
People who travel to different countries can have a better understanding of these countries and ______ or increase wealth. Some young people can visit other countries where they can find better jobs and ______. Some small business owners can discover business opportunities during their trips to foreign countries and ______ by exporting or importing products. If air tickets are expensive, these business people will fly less frequently to other countries and ______ some opportunities to ______.  
环境  
At the same time, some may argue that ______ can help reduce the environmental impact of the airline industry. Higher prices will ______ travelling great distances to other locations to ______. Greenhouse gases produced by aeroplanes can decrease if the number of air flights ______. Other problems related to the aviation sector, including noise pollution and the ______ caused by the construction of airports and other facilities, will also be mitigated.  
压力 美食  
Personally, I do not think it is necessary to make air services expensive to potential passengers, because they deserve an affordable holiday to relax. Many people, especially ______ living in large cities, ______ and feel stressed. If air tickets are highly affordable, they may choose to take a vacation in some exotic locations, tropical countries where they can ______ and ______, and ______ the everyday life of their own countries.  

Overall, it would be wrong to ______ air travel, and above all, cheap airlines can benefit the public. Air companies can turn to ______ as part of an effort to reduce the train on the environment.

## 20法律. :rotating_light:laws refer to rules:
Laws ______ rules imposed on human beings. Although laws ______ regulating our behaviour, I believe that strict laws can also restrict our freedom.  
交通 假货 交流  
If no law regulated people's behaviour, a country would be ______, and the economy would collapse(suffer). For example, if people do not obey traffic regulations, traffic accidents will increase, and ______ will become a problem. The ______ of numerous businesses will be affected because their products cannot be delivered efficiently. Similarly, in a country where there is no law to punish those merchants who sell fake products online, consumers will stop shopping on the Internet, and this country will suffer economically. ______ are also important. Otherwise, people will not be able to develop a ______ relationship. They are sometimes motivated by self-interest to do something that would be harmful to others, such as ______ of their business partners, but this would cause damage to their relationship. If people do not ______, they will find it difficult to conduct business together, and arguments will reduce productivity. It is fair to say that no society can function well when people ______.  
高税  
On the other hand, laws sometimes inevitably restrain human freedom and even ______. For instance, if one country has many restrictions on the business world, business activity will not ______. High-income earners who are subject to high-income tax rates may ______ make greater efforts to ______. The government can relax regulations to unlock the potential of these people, which can contribute to social progress.  

From what has been discussed, it is reasonable to argue that a country cannot operate well without laws and rules. Alternatively, our society can not advance easily if laws are too restrictive.

## 21税收. :tickets:tax revenue:
社会  
Many people ______ a burden because it can reduce their disposable income. I think that we need to pay taxes because without ______, society can not function appropriately.  
公共设施 交通 学校    行为 抽烟  
If the government has tax revenue, more funds can be used to ______ such as roads, schools and hospitals. Without a great public transport system, commuters find it difficult to travel to and from work, and traffic congestion could reduce work efficiency. Public schools can provide children with educational opportunities, and without a well-educated workforce, a country cannot sustain economic growth. Private investors are normally not interested in transport links and schools, which do not ______.     Levying taxes can also regulate people's behaviour and encourage them, especially those who sometimes fail to show self-restraint, to break bad habits. For example, the heavy tax on cigarettes and alcohol discourages the public from spending on these items. The resulting lifestyle changes can ______ and reduce hospital visits, thereby ______ the medical system.  
钱动力  
On the other hand, if taxpayers are subject to high taxes, they may not ______ work hard, and entrepreneurs are also not willing to set up a business. Money is a great motivator for most people because, with a high income, they can ______ and ______. Without the hard work of these people and their willingness to ______, a country would not become prosperous, and the welfare system could not be sustained.  

Overall, I am convinced that taxes are the lifeblood of the economy, although high taxes can have an adverse effect on economic growth.

## 22艺术. :mag:public art !artworks:mag::
服务设施  
The government sometimes ______ when spending its budget on public art, especially in economically tough times. I reckon that we should ______ essential ______ and then fund the arts when there is a budget surplus.  
吸引 动态 减压  
The supporters of public funds for the arts argue that cities can become more visually attractive because of art. It is true that artworks, including ______, can decorate public facilities such as libraries, metro stations, or even toilets and increase the ______ of these places. If the art industry prospers, cities will have art exhibitions, art festivals and other cultural activities, which can make urban life ______. Exposure to artwork can ______.  
水电 发展 路（不）  
Despite this, many people would argue that public facilities deserve more public money. Ordinary people are more interested in public facilities (such as water and electricity supply networks, schools, libraries and roads), which have a direct impact on their living standards. For example, good sanitation and clean water can improve young people's ______. In contrast, sculptures, paintings and operas are luxury items to most people and are not likely to ______ them. In my view, improvements in public facilities can promote economic development, but the arts may be less important in economic terms. For example, the investment in the transport system can improve the productivity of working people by making daily commuting easier, while public spending on high-speed railway systems and airports can ensure that cargo can be delivered faster. Cities can attract investment and become wealthy, so people's ______ can also be improved. By contrast, the investment in the arts cannot ______.  

To sum up, I believe that the government should ______ vital to the well-being of the general public, even though artistic projects can make our cities spectacular.  
```

services and infrastructures
sculptures, paintings and statues

## 23监狱. :bricks:lengthy prison sentence:
其他  
Imposing sentences is widely accepted to punish those who ______ and sometimes as a correctional method. This approach may be practical, but we should consider other ways to ______ offenders.  
自由 再犯  
The prison sentence may have a deterrent effect on either ______ offenders. A lengthy prison sentence means that those who ______ will lose freedom for a prolonged period, a consequence that no rational person is willing to take. The criminal record can have a lasting impact on their lives, including their career. They will not ______ when they realise the problems that ensue; instead, they will choose to find work or run a small business to ______. This can help create a peaceful and safe community.  
服务 教育  
While I agree that a lengthy prison term may sometimes help us fight crime, we can consider community service as an alternative. They can learn how to act as meaningful ______ by ______, and realise that they can contribute to society. If they are sentenced to prison, they may make friends whit other offenders. So they may re-offend after being released, which can ______ other members of society.     We can also provide them with ______, improving their interpersonal and job skills. It is worth noting that many juvenile offenders or first-time offenders break the law because of a lack of social experience or low socio-economic status. Crime is ______ if they can find work and understand legal responsibilities. The prison can isolate criminals from society, ______ in finding work and ______ society.  

I agree that the ______ can ______, but it is not the best approach. The focus should be on changing the behaviour of offenders and helping them ______ productive members of society.  
```

## 24交易. :convenience_store:exchange of commodities:
国际化  
As the world is increasingly globalised, the ______ across the border is ______ at an astounding rate. From my point of view, this development can help improve the ______ of consumers.  
实惠 自己 别人  
The products from foreign countries are competitively ______ and offer good value for money. The main reason is that the countries which export these typical goods have the ______ to reduce the cost of production to ensure that these products are highly affordable. For example, China ______ producing textile products, so China-made clothes, linen and footwear are cheaper than their local counterparts in many parts of the world.   Another benefit is that imported goods have challenged domestic manufacturers' dominance and ______, ______ these producers to cut prices. It is beneficial to domestic customers because they can spend less on products essential to their lives, such as food, and the cost of living will decline. This is particularly important for people who live on a tight budget and need to ______.  
市场 电子产品  
The downside of importing goods is that foreign brands may ______ local companies' ______ and lead to some domestic industries' underdevelopment. These brands have been in ______ for many decades, attracting local consumers with clear advantages in ______. For instance, Dell, Apple, HP and other world-famous producers of computers and electronic products have conquered many markets, and the arrival of these international brands has ______ domestic manufacturers' bankruptcy. This is harmful to the development of a self-contained economy.  

In conclusion, importing products from other countries is positive overall. Consumers can buy something at a lower cost, although some local firms may be shut down.
